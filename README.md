# Game Development

This is a folder that contains all the projects I've done so far. I started finding myself gravitating towards Game Development after a few encounters on media platforms, such as YouTube, where creators would show their game development timeline. This began to attract me towards the prospect of creating one, why couldn't I? I had learnt how to code proficiently using OOP in Java and decided to go for it. This folder details my adventures in to the world of Unity Engine. Unity Engine requires the usage of the C# language. I started diving in to Unity Engine at the end of December 2020.

## Moley (Name might changed):

This is the first major project that I've started to create in Unity Engine. Moley is a 2D mobile (Android exclusive) game, it was heavily inspired by a game called Spelunky and how their procedural generation would create a unique experience each time you play. In Moley however, you are a mole (?) that begins traversing through a procedurally generated map with their own little twist and turns. A partner has decided to aid me in my project, which is a major aid in my quest, and they have taken over the Art Aspect of the game. I am now solely focusing on constructing the code, audio, and functionalities in the game.
